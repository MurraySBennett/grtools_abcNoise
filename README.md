# grtools
**R package for the analysis of perceptual independence using general recognition theory.**

**grtools** provides functions for the following analyses:

1. Model-based analyses of separability and independence with GRT-wIND (Soto et al., 2015) for the 2x2 identification experiment.
2. Model-based analyses of separability and independence with traditional GRT models for the 2x2 identification experiment (Ashby & Soto, 2015).
3. Summary statistics analysis (i.e. Kadlec's MSDA; see Kadlec & Townsend, 1992) for the 2x2 identification experiment.
4. Summary statistics analysis for the 2x2 Garner filtering task (Ashby & Maddox, 1994).

A tutorial introduction to GRT analyses using **grtools** can be found in [this *Frontiers In Psychology* paper](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00696/full).

**Note that this package is still under development. This is a pre-release version that has not been extensively tested. We welcome your comments, feature requests, bug reports, etc.**

# Installation

Of course, you will need R, which you can download [here](http://cran.rstudio.com/). It is also a good idea to install RStudio, which you can download [here](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

## 1. Installing pre-requisites
**grtools** requires [Rcpp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) to work, which in turn requires a development environment with a suitable compiler. If you already have this, go to step 2.

If you do not have a C++ compiler installed, see the [Rcpp FAQ](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-FAQ.pdf), particularly points 1.2 and 1.3. More detailed instructions on how to install the compiler can be found [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Mac-OS-X-Prerequisite-Installation-Instructions) for Mac OS X (this page belongs to a different project that uses the same pre-requisites as grtools; please ignore instructions to install RStan), and [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Install-Rtools-for-Windows) for Windows.


## 2. Installing grtools
The easiest way to install **grtools** and its dependencies is using devtools. Open RStudio or R, and in the console type:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fsotoc/grtools", dependencies="Imports")
```

After installation, type the following in the R console:

```R
library(grtools)
?grtools
```

This will open a document that includes links to help documentation for each of the main analyses included in **grtools** (including examples). Sometimes the command ```?grtools``` produces an error instead of displaying the documentation. Simply quitting and re-opening R typically solves this problem.
