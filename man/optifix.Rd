\title{optifix. Optimise with fixed parameters}
\usage{
optifix(
  par,
  fixed,
  fn,
  gr = NULL,
  ...,
  method = c("Nelder-Mead", "BFGS", "CG", "L-BFGS-B", "SANN"),
  lower = -Inf,
  upper = Inf,
  control = list(),
  hessian = FALSE
)
}
\description{
its like optim, but with fixed parameters.
}
\details{
specify a second argument 'fixed', a vector of numerical values.
There are three options
(a) To indicate that the parameter in fn() is optimised over, use 0
(b) To indicate that the parameter in fn() is fixed to its starting value, 
use its index. Thus, if the Nth parameter in fn() is fixed to the starting
value, then fixed[N] <- N.
(c) To indicate that the parameter in fn() is fixed to the value of another
parameter, use the index of that parameter. Thus, if the Nth parameter in fn()
should have the same value as the Mth parameter, then fixed[N] <- M.

The return thing is the return thing from optim() but with a couple of extra
bits - a vector of all the parameters and a vector copy of the 'fixed' argument.
